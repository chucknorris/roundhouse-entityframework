RoundhouseE Refresh Database with Entity Framework Migrations

This allows you to generate SQL files for use with RoundhousE or just to give to your DBAs in cases where RH is not able to be run across all environments.  
  
There is a sample available in the samples folder.  

## Instructions

1. These files should be in a console project with x86 (and not Client Profile).
1. Add a reference to the project where you have your migrations.
1. Look through these options and set them appropriately.
